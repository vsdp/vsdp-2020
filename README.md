# VSDP: Verified SemiDefinite-quadratic-linear Programming (Version 2020)

> This is the latest version of VSDP.

VSDP is a software package that is designed for the computation of verified
results in conic programming.  It supports the constraint cone consisting of the
product of semidefinite cones, second-order cones and the nonnegative orthant.
It provides functions for computing rigorous error bounds of the true optimal
value, verified enclosures of epsilon-optimal  solutions, and verified
certificates of infeasibility.  All rounding errors due to floating-point
arithmetic are taken into account.

The software is completely written in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com) /
[GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave) and requires the interval
toolbox [INTLAB](https://www.tuhh.de/ti3/rump/intlab/).  Thus interval input is
supported as well.

This version of VSDP provides easy access to the conic solvers:
- [CSDP](https://github.com/coin-or/Csdp),
  [GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk),
  [LINPROG](https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/linprog.html),
  [lp_solve](https://lpsolve.sourceforge.io),
  [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com),
  [SDPA](https://sdpa.sourceforge.io),
  [SDPT3](http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/SDPT3.html), and
  [SeDuMi](http://sedumi.ie.lehigh.edu).
